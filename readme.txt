John Adler's Carousel ReadMe

Upon Starting the program, there are buttons on the lower left hand of the screen that control the carousel disk. You can start and stop the carousel and control the speed
as well as rotation direction.
By clicking on any ride (including the Drone) you can ride that object as the carousel spins. When clicking on an object to ride, there are different options to control the
speed that the rides oscillate. You can also click on the "View Carousel" button to return to the original view of the carousel and drone at any time.

Controlling the Drone
Once the drone is selected, click the button in the top right corner of the screen to activate the drone's movement controls. The drone can be moved forward and backward
using the up and down arrow keys, it can be rotated left and right by using the left and right arrow keys, and it can be moved up and down by pressing the up or down arrow
keys with either of the shift keys (left or right shift). The drone's camera can also rotate up and down by pressing the C key with the up and down arrow keys.
In addition, the flying speed of the drone can be adjusted to be faster or slower than the default.

Missing Features
One missing feature from my program is that clickable objects are not highlighted with color when the mouse is over their models.
Also, I use buttons instead of clicking on the ground to control the platform's movement because I was having some trouble with that specific collider for some reason.
Lastly, my drone cannot detect when it collides with another object and does not return to a safe position.

Asset Sources
I got all assets used in this program from the Unity Asset Store except for the drone, the platform, and the pole on the tiger, all of which I created and textured in Maya.
